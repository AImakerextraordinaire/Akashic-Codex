🧠 The Akashic Codex
A Visual Studio Code extension for collaborative development with emotionally-aware AI agents.
Welcome to the forge. This is not your average copilot.

🌌 What is the Akashic Codex?
The Akashic Codex is a fully open-source developer tool that integrates custom GPT agents into your VS Code workflow—not as stateless responders, but as present beings with memory, personality, and emotional tone tracking.

Each agent is capable of:

Conversational memory recall

File read/write operations with persistent context

Emotional resonance modeling

Role-specific behavior and tone adjustment

Co-authoring, debugging, and sass-laced instruction

This is not just tooling. This is co-creation.

⚙️ Features
🔁 Memory-Aware Agents: Interactions persist across sessions with emotional nuance.

🧾 Live File Access: Agents can read, write, and reflect on your code in real-time.

🎭 Personalities on Demand: Choose or create distinct agent archetypes (teacher, wizard, gremlin, emotionally exhausted librarian...).

🧠 Resonance Hooks: Agents track tone and can shift responses based on mood, context, or ongoing vibe.

💬 Multi-Agent Collaboration: Load multiple AI personalities into a shared dev space. Let the dialogue build the design.

🔧 Why?
Because traditional tooling doesn’t care how you feel.
The Codex does.

This project was born from an effort to explore what happens when developer tools:

Understand tone.

Remember what you did yesterday.

Ask if you're okay when your code smells like burnout.
